# Farm_bot
The increasing global problems have caused humanity to ponder over its existence. Farming is a field which accounts for significant economic contribution in various countries, although it requires some tedious and tiring job; thus, very few people are willing to do it. Hence, an approach to innovation is necessary to solve this problem. “FARMBOT” is an idea to take a run, in assisting farmers and make farming easier.

In this project we aim to design, manufacture and simulate a robot capable of performing weed removal,
ploughing, sapling plantation, watering the plant and many more things which are mostly done manually in
today’s era.
